The UIC BEI LAB Vertical Camera Slider is a precision-engineered device designed for smooth, vertical camera movements, ideal for photography and videography applications. 
The system is powered by Arduino, utilizing stepper motors to provide accurate and controlled motion along the vertical axis. The user input commands via the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE, specifying parameters such as travel distance, and direction. 
The Arduino processes these commands and controls the stepper motors accordingly. The timing belt and pulley system then translates the motor's rotation into vertical motion, moving the camera platform along the slider's track. 
This system is designed for ease of use, precision, and reliability, making it an essential tool for capturing dynamic, professional-quality footage along the vertical plane.

**Pan Mode:** The Pan Mode in the UIC BEI LAB Vertical Camera Slider system allows users to control the vertical movement of the slider with precision using an Arduino-controlled stepper motor. Upon initiation, the user selects the direction and specifies the distance for the camera's travel, which the system then calculates and executes in motor pulses. The program provides real-time updates and can be repeated or terminated as needed. This mode, accessible remotely via Chrome Remote Desktop, is essential for achieving precise and repeatable camera positioning. 

**Rotate Mode:** The Rotate Mode in the UIC BEI LAB Vertical Camera Slider system allows users to control the rotational movement of the camera using an Arduino-controlled stepper motor. In this mode, the user specifies the direction (forward or reverse) and the desired rotation angle, which the system translates into the necessary motor pulses. The motor executes these pulses to achieve precise camera rotation, continuously updating the user with the step count. This mode supports repeated operations and can be accessed remotely via Chrome Remote Desktop, ensuring precise and repeatable rotational positioning for various shooting scenarios.

**Pan and Rotate Mode:** The Pan and Rotate Mode in the UIC BEI LAB Vertical Camera Slider system allows users to control both the vertical and rotational movements of the camera with precision using an Arduino-controlled stepper motor system. In this mode, the user can specify the direction and distance for vertical travel, as well as the direction (forward or reverse) and angle for rotational movement. The system calculates the necessary motor pulses for both movements and executes them in tandem, providing real-time updates on the progress. This combined mode is essential for achieving complex camera positioning, allowing for precise and repeatable movements in both vertical and rotational directions. The program supports repeated operations and can be accessed remotely via Chrome Remote Desktop, making it a versatile tool for various shooting scenarios where both vertical and rotational adjustments are required.
